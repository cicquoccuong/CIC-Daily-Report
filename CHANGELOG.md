## [0.30.1] - 2026-03-23

### Prompt Quality — NQ05 Input→Output Shift + Anti-filler + Emoji Formatting

After reviewing real pipeline output (2026-03-22 + 2026-03-23), identified that NQ05
restrictions in prompts caused LLM self-censorship → generic filler content.

#### NQ05 Prompt Slim (all content types)
- **NQ05_SYSTEM_PROMPT**: Removed verbose COMPLIANCE section (4 rules) + CỤM TỪ CẤM
  (7 banned phrases) → replaced with 1-line NQ05 reminder. NQ05 enforcement now
  exclusively via post-filter (Layer 2).
- **Tier Articles**: Removed NQ05 from ⛔ KHÔNG list, slimmed format instructions.
- **Summary**: Removed NQ05 line from QUY TẮC.
- **Research**: Removed 2 NQ05 lines (section 8 + QUY TẮC CHUNG).

#### Breaking News Prompt Rewrite
- **Positive instructions**: "CHUYỆN GÌ XẢY RA" (đoạn 1) + "TẠI SAO QUAN TRỌNG" (đoạn 2)
  — prevents paragraph duplication.
- **Anti-filler**: Explicit ban on "Điều này cho thấy...", "có thể ảnh hưởng đến...",
  "trong bối cảnh..." — replaced by "kết thúc bằng HỆ QUẢ CỤ THỂ".
- **Neutral tone**: "Tin xấu → nêu rủi ro THẬT, KHÔNG giảm nhẹ" — prevents AI from
  spinning security incidents as positive PR.
- **Emoji markers**: 📌 title, paragraphs without rigid headings.

#### Digest Prompt Rewrite
- Same anti-filler treatment: each item ends with specific consequence, not generic filler.
- **bold** for all numbers (price, %, quantity, dates).

#### NQ05 Post-filter (2 new patterns)
- `cơ hội...tích lũy/mua vào/mua thêm` — catches implicit buy recommendations.
- `nhà đầu tư/bạn nên...mua/bán/tích lũy` — catches "should buy/sell" variants.

#### Emoji & Format
- Tier Articles: emoji guidance (📈📉⚡📊🔍💡), mobile-friendly paragraph style.
- Breaking: 📌 title marker consistent across all breaking news.

## [0.30.0] - 2026-03-22

### Major Overhaul — Pipeline Reliability, Content Quality & Architecture (6 clusters, 19 fixes)

Root cause investigation after 20+ duplicate breaking news sends on 2026-03-22. Found cascading
failures across dedup persistence, LLM fallback chain, content quality, and missing monitoring.

#### Cụm 1: Dedup & Sheets Persistence (Triple-send root cause)
- **atomic_rewrite()**: New Sheets write method — single `ws.update()` call replacing non-atomic
  delete+append pattern. If write fails, old data remains intact.
- **URL-based dedup**: First check in dedup chain — same URL = same article, regardless of
  AI-generated title differences across runs.
- **Fatal dedup load**: `_load_dedup_from_sheets()` retries 3x with exponential backoff, then
  raises `RuntimeError` instead of silently returning empty state (which would re-send everything).
- **atomic_rewrite for BREAKING_LOG**: `_persist_dedup_to_sheets()` uses atomic_rewrite as primary
  strategy with append-only fallback for new entries.

#### Cụm 2: Daily Pipeline LLM Cascade
- **Per-provider circuit breaker**: Replaced global `_all_providers_failed` boolean with
  per-provider `_provider_failed` dict. Gemini failing no longer blocks Groq.
- **Early return tuple fix**: `_execute_stages()` early returns now return 4-tuple
  `([], errors, "", 0)` matching caller's expected `articles, errors, llm_used, research_wc`.
- **60s cooldown**: Added cooldown before Summary/Research generation to let per-minute rate
  limit window reset after 5+ tier article generations.
- **Shared rate limiter**: Gemini Flash + Flash Lite share 15 RPM total via `_SHARED_RATE_GROUPS`.
  Each gets 7 RPM (14 combined, 1 RPM headroom).

#### Cụm 5: Critical vs Important Architecture (Decision 1C + 2B)
- **Separate delivery flows**: Critical (🔴) events → individual articles sent immediately.
  Important (🟠) events → batched into themed digest (reduces Telegram noise).
- **Night mode 07:00 VN run**: Added `0 0 * * *` UTC to breaking-news cron for morning
  deferred event delivery at 07:00 VN.
- **Digest emoji**: Important digest uses 🟠 header instead of 🔴.

#### Cụm 6: Monitoring & Admin Alerts
- **`send_admin_alert()`**: Fire-and-forget Telegram notification for pipeline failures.
  Silently swallows all errors — monitoring never crashes the pipeline.
- **Breaking pipeline alert**: Notifies on pipeline error/timeout with error summary.
- **Daily pipeline alert**: Notifies on error/timeout with article count and errors.
- **Research skip alert**: Notifies when research article fails quality gate.

#### Cụm 3: Breaking News Content Quality
- **CIC context in prompt**: Added community context (Crypto Investment Community, experienced
  members) so LLM writes for the right audience.
- **Higher word targets**: Critical 200-250 → 300-400, Important 100-150 → 200-300 words.
- **Deeper source content**: Article extraction increased 1500→3000 chars, timeout 8→12s.
- **Labeled context sections**: Market snapshot and recent events now have clear headers
  in the prompt to help LLM distinguish data sources.
- **Narrowed NQ05 patterns**: Removed over-aggressive semantic patterns that stripped legitimate
  analysis (support/resistance levels, "nhà đầu tư nên theo dõi", market expectations).

#### Cụm 4: Research Article
- **Decoupled from tier generation**: Research article now attempts generation whenever LLM
  is available, not gated by `if generated:`. Research uses raw pipeline data (context),
  not generated tier articles.

## [0.29.1] - 2026-03-21

### Bug Fixes — Content Quality & Pipeline Reliability (7 bugs + 1 improvement)

Post-release review of v0.29.0 found 7 bugs across content generation and pipeline flow.

#### P0: Content Quality
- **(BUG 7) NQ05 filler removal → WARN-only**: Reverted filler phrase removal (v0.28.0)
  back to warn-only. The 7 filler patterns (`có thể ảnh hưởng đến`, `trong bối cảnh`,
  `điều này cho thấy`, etc.) are structural Vietnamese grammar — removing them from prose
  destroyed sentence structure, producing unreadable breaking news. Filler reduction now
  handled via improved LLM prompt instructions instead.
- **NQ05 sentence-level removal**: `_remove_sentences_with_pattern()` now removes entire
  *sentences* containing NQ05 violations (banned keywords, allocation patterns, semantic
  patterns) instead of just the matching phrase. Prevents broken grammar when violations
  are structural parts of sentences. Multi-sentence lines keep clean sentences intact.

#### P1: Pipeline Flow
- **(BUG 1) Deferred reprocess persist**: `_reprocess_deferred_events()` now persists dedup
  status to Sheets after reprocessing. Without this, status changes were lost if pipeline
  exited before final persist — causing deferred events to be re-sent next run.
- **(BUG 2) Early return persist**: Both early-return paths (`if not events` / `if not
  dedup_result.new_events`) now persist dedup state when deferred events were sent.
- **(BUG 4) Individual path count-after-delivery**: `events_sent` and `sent_events.append()`
  moved AFTER successful `_deliver_single_breaking()`. Previously counted before delivery —
  if Telegram failed, counts were inflated and run log showed false success.
- **(BUG 6) Digest path count-after-delivery**: Same fix for digest mode — `events_sent +=
  len(send_now)` moved after all Telegram sends complete.

#### P2: Status Tracking
- **(BUG 3) `_STATUS_PRIORITY` completeness**: Added `sent_digest` (5), `delivery_failed`
  (4), and `deferred_overflow` (2) to `DedupManager._STATUS_PRIORITY`. Missing entries
  defaulted to priority 0, causing incorrect hash collision resolution.
- **(BUG 5) `delivery_failed` status**: Distinguish delivery failure from generation failure.
  If content was generated successfully but Telegram send failed, status is now
  `delivery_failed` (not `generation_failed`). `_reprocess_deferred_events()` also retries
  `delivery_failed` entries.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-03-21

### Breaking Pipeline Reliability Overhaul (12 issues / 5 root-cause layers / 15 fixes)

Root-cause investigation of "AI không khả dụng" errors and burst-sending behavior
revealed a 5-layer causal chain from false-positive detection through infinite loop.
All 12 issues resolved across 6 implementation phases.

#### Layer 1: Quota & Rate Limiting
- **(A2) track_failure()**: `QuotaManager` now updates `last_call_time` on failed API calls,
  preventing rapid-fire retries against rate-limited providers (was: only updated on success)
- **(A3) Shared LLMAdapter**: Single `LLMAdapter` instance for entire pipeline run — was
  creating 3 separate instances (main, RSS fallback, deferred), each with independent
  QuotaManagers that couldn't coordinate rate limits

#### Layer 2: Circuit Breaker
- **(A7) Circuit breaker**: After all LLM providers fail once, subsequent `generate()` calls
  fail fast without making API requests. Resets on next successful response
- **(C1) Health check**: Pipeline verifies LLM availability with a ping before batch
  processing — opens circuit breaker early if all providers are down

#### Layer 3: Error Handling
- **(A4) Error propagation**: `generate_breaking_content()` no longer silently catches LLM
  errors and sends "AI không khả dụng" raw data. Exceptions propagate to caller, which marks
  events as `generation_failed` for retry in next run
- **(B4) Skip enrichment**: When LLM is known down, skip 8-second article fetch
  (trafilatura) — saves time when content generation will fail anyway

#### Layer 4: Flow Control
- **(A6/B3) Priority ordering**: Events sorted by severity (Critical → Important → Notable)
  before processing — ensures most important events get LLM quota first
- **(B1) Event cap**: Max 5 events per run (`MAX_EVENTS_PER_RUN`). Overflow events deferred
  to next run as `deferred_overflow` instead of exhausting all quota
- **(A8) Deferred cap**: Max 5 deferred events reprocessed per run (`MAX_DEFERRED_PER_RUN`)
- **(B2) Inter-event delay**: 30-second gap between Telegram sends (`INTER_EVENT_DELAY`).
  Prevents burst-sending dozens of alerts simultaneously
- **(B5) Digest mode**: When ≥5 events need sending, generate single combined summary
  via `generate_digest_content()` instead of individual messages
- **(A5) Incremental persist**: Dedup state saved after each successful send (not just at
  end). Prevents timeout → dedup lost → re-send loop (the infinite loop root cause)

#### Layer 5: False Positive Reduction
- **(C2) Context-aware keywords**: Split keywords into ALWAYS_TRIGGER (hack, exploit,
  rug pull, delisting, bankrupt) and CONTEXT_REQUIRED (crash, collapse, SEC, ban,
  emergency). Generic keywords only fire when title also contains a crypto-related word.
  Prevents "plane crash" from triggering crypto breaking alerts

## [0.28.0] - 2026-03-21

### Quality Audit Fixes (42 issues / 8 root causes / 7 clusters)

Comprehensive QA/QC audit of pipeline output identified 42 issues across 8 root causes.
All fixes organized into 7 implementation clusters:

#### Cluster 5: Security & Delivery
- **API key sanitization**: `error_notifier.py` now strips API keys from error messages
  before sending to Telegram (regex redaction for Google, Groq, OpenAI key formats)
- **Link preview disabled**: Added `link_preview_options: {is_disabled: true}` to Telegram
  `sendMessage` payload to prevent unwanted URL previews in articles

#### Cluster 4: Data Integrity
- **Synthetic data warning**: Altcoin Season Index fallback now marked as
  `source="SYNTHETIC (BlockchainCenter unavailable)"` to prevent LLM misinterpretation
- **Narrative word boundary**: `metrics_engine.py` narrative detection upgraded from
  substring matching to `re.search(r"\b...\b")` — fixes false positives like "ADA" in "Canada"

#### Cluster 2: NQ05 Post-Filter
- **Filler removal**: Upgraded from WARN-only to REMOVE — filler phrases are now actively
  stripped from generated content (was: counted but preserved)
- **7 new semantic NQ05 patterns**: Added detection for price predictions, investor
  recommendations, price targets, support/resistance levels

#### Cluster 1: Prompt Engineering
- **Tier-specific data headers**: Each tier now cites only its actual data sources
  (L1: CoinLore+alternative.me, L5: all sources) instead of generic "CoinLore, CoinGecko, yfinance"
- **Format simplification**: Removed dual "Tóm lược/Phân tích chi tiết" structure that
  caused within-tier repetition — articles now write in continuous flow

#### Cluster 3: Output Validation
- **Fabrication blocking**: `_validate_output()` → `_validate_and_clean_output()` —
  fabricated metrics and banned source citations are now REMOVED from content (was: log warning only)

#### Cluster 6: Breaking News
- **Entity-based dedup**: New `_is_entity_overlap()` in `dedup_manager.py` — catches
  duplicate events with different wording by comparing named entity overlap (Jaccard similarity)
- **Crypto relevance filter**: New `_is_crypto_relevant()` in `severity_classifier.py` —
  non-crypto events (e.g., sports betting) are skipped instead of triggering breaking alerts

#### Cluster 7: Quota Management
- **Quota awareness**: Added `remaining()` and `has_budget()` methods to `QuotaManager`
  for pipeline to check quota before optional tasks (research, summary)

#### Unified Coin Name↔Ticker Mapping (Config-Driven)
- **New `core/coin_mapping.py`**: Config-driven name→ticker resolution. Primary source:
  DANH_SACH_COIN "Tên đầy đủ" column (operator-managed). Fallback: hardcoded 30+ entries.
  Operator adds new coin + name on Sheet → pipeline recognizes it, no code change needed.
- **`config_loader.get_coin_name_map()`**: New method reads "Tên đầy đủ" column, populates
  `coin_mapping.load_from_config()` at pipeline startup (daily + breaking)
- **Breaking pipeline**: `_extract_coins_from_title()` now recognizes project names, not just
  uppercase tickers — fixes "Ripple partners with bank" being filtered out despite XRP tracked
- **Severity classifier**: Added 20+ missing project names (ripple, dogecoin, avalanche, polkadot,
  chainlink, litecoin, etc.) — synced with data_cleaner keywords
- **Dedup manager**: `_ENTITY_SYNONYMS` now derived from shared `coin_mapping` instead of isolated dict
- **L2 validation**: Coin count now uses `extract_coins_from_text()` — "Ethereum" counts as ETH
- **CryptoPanic**: `currencies` field from API now stored in `coin_symbol` column (was: discarded)

### Tests
- 751 tests pass (+70 from v0.27.0)
- New `test_coin_mapping.py`: 13 tests for normalize/extract/consistency
- New breaking pipeline tests: project name extraction (Ripple→XRP, Cardano→ADA)
- New severity classifier tests: 6 project name recognition tests
- New CryptoPanic tests: currencies field storage
- Updated test assertions for filler removal behavior change
- Updated test for prompt format change (Tóm lược removal)

## [0.27.0] - 2026-03-20

### P2-A: CIC Market Insight Research Article (BIC Group L1)

New feature: generates a >2500-word deep analysis research article for BIC Group L1 paid members.
Series name: "CIC Market Insight — Ngày DD/MM/YYYY"

#### New Files
- **`collectors/research_data.py`**: Research-specific data collector with 5 free sources:
  - BGeometrics: MVRV Z-Score, NUPL, SOPR, Puell Multiple (15 req/day, no key)
  - btcetffundflow.com: Spot Bitcoin ETF daily flows for 13 ETFs (scraping __NEXT_DATA__)
  - DefiLlama Stablecoins: USDT/USDC supply + 1d/7d/30d flow changes (no key)
  - Blockchain.com: Miner Revenue, Difficulty, Hash Rate (no key)
  - Binance Spot: Pi Cycle Top indicator (calculated from 111SMA & 350SMA×2)
- **`generators/research_generator.py`**: Research article generator with:
  - 8-section article structure (Overview, Alerts, On-chain, Stablecoin/ETF, Derivatives, Macro, Summary Table, Conclusion)
  - Research-grade NQ05-compliant system prompt
  - 8192 max tokens for >2500 word output
  - NQ05 compliance: prompt-level + pipeline Stage 3 post-filter (consistent with tier articles)

#### Pipeline Integration (daily_pipeline.py)
- Stage 1: `collect_research_data()` added to parallel data collection
- Stage 2: `generate_research_article()` runs after BIC Chat summary
- Stage 3: Research article passes through NQ05 post-filter (same as tier articles)
- Stage 4: Delivered as tier="Research" alongside existing articles

#### Data Stack (all verified free, no credit card required)
| Source | Data | API Calls/Day |
|--------|------|---------------|
| BGeometrics | MVRV-Z, NUPL, SOPR, Puell | 4 |
| btcetffundflow.com | ETF flows (13 ETFs) | 1 |
| DefiLlama | Stablecoin supply/flow | 1 |
| Blockchain.com | Miner Revenue, Difficulty | 1 |
| Binance Spot | Pi Cycle (calculated) | 1 |
| + Existing pipeline | Market, On-chain, Derivatives, Sector, News | ~30 |

#### Tests
- `tests/test_collectors/test_research_data.py`: 15 tests covering all 5 data sources + format + edge cases
- `tests/test_generators/test_research_generator.py`: 11 tests covering context, prompt, NQ05, generation + quality gate

#### Review Fixes (post-implementation QA)
- **Quality gate**: `generate_research_article()` returns `None` when content <800 words (pipeline skips gracefully); warns when <1500 words
- **NQ05 single-layer**: Removed duplicate `check_and_fix()` from generator — NQ05 post-filter now only in pipeline Stage 3 (consistent with tier articles)
- **Stablecoin data consistency**: `circulating.peggedUSD` used as single source of truth for market cap (not mixing with `chainCirculating`)
- **ETF 5-day trend**: Added `recent_total_flows` to `ETFFlowData` — LLM receives 5-day flow trend for analysis, not just latest day
- **Section 7 rewrite**: Changed from "So sánh hôm nay vs hôm qua" (requires yesterday's data) to "Bảng tổng hợp chỉ số chính" (summary table)
- **Removed bond yield**: Prompt no longer requires US Bond 10Y/2Y yield data (no source available)
- **Missing data handling**: Added "XỬ LÝ THIẾU DỮ LIỆU" instructions to prompt — LLM skips sections without data instead of fabricating
- **Stablecoin zero change**: Fixed Python falsy bug — `change_1d=0.0` now formats as "+0" instead of showing "N/A"
- **Sheets truncation**: Increased content limit from 8,000 to 45,000 chars (research articles ~12-15K chars, Sheets cell limit 50K)
- **Run log tracking**: `_execute_stages()` returns research word count; NHAT_KY_PIPELINE notes field shows `research: Nw` for traceability
- **Source hyperlinks (PA E)**: Breaking news `🔗 <a href="url">Nguồn: Source ↗</a>` — full clickable hyperlink in Telegram, replacing plain-text URL
- **Deferred event fallback**: Reuses `_raw_data_fallback()` with HTML hyperlinks instead of separate plain-text template

## [0.26.0] - 2026-03-20

### Content Quality — Investor-Focused Insight Upgrade (Phase 1)

#### 1. Tier Context Rewrite (daily_pipeline.py)
- All 5 tier_context prompts rewritten with **investor persona** matching CIC member profiles:
  - L1: Beginner investor (BTC/ETH, 10-30M VND, ADCA strategy)
  - L2: Bluechip diversifier (19 coins, 30-60M VND, sector allocation)
  - L3: Experienced mid-cap investor (50+ coins, 60-150M VND, causal analysis)
  - L4: DeFi/infrastructure specialist (100+ coins, 150-300M VND, risk assessment)
  - L5: Master investor (full portfolio, >300M VND, strategic + seasonal cycle)
- Each tier now asks questions relevant to **long-term investors**, not traders
- Example prompts updated to demonstrate insight-driven analysis

#### 2. NQ05 System Prompt Upgrade (article_generator.py)
- Added CIC community context (ADCA strategy, 4-season cycle, busy investors)
- **Mandatory insight requirements**: each article MUST contain:
  - 1+ causal link between 2+ indicators
  - 1+ anomaly or contradiction from data
  - 0 sentences that merely restate numbers without interpretation
- Added 2 more banned filler phrases commonly seen in output
- Analysis process now includes explicit "find contradictions" step

#### 3. Metrics Engine Enhancement (metrics_engine.py)
- `_analyze_cross_signals()`: New **specific contradiction detection**:
  - Retail vs Pro: F&G extreme + Funding Rate opposite direction
  - Macro vs Sentiment: DXY direction vs F&G direction conflict
  - Price vs Volume: divergence detection (bull trap warning)
- Each contradiction includes **interpretation + risk implication**
- `format_for_tier()`: Tier-specific framing enhanced:
  - L1-L2: Added investor-relevant context for accumulation guidance
  - L3: Now receives cross-signal contradictions (not just L4)
  - L4: Risk framing specific to DeFi/infrastructure portfolios
  - L5: Added **seasonal cycle context** (Winter/Spring/Summer/Fall)

#### 4. Breaking News Filter (breaking_pipeline.py)
- `_filter_non_cic_coins()`: Added parenthetical coin detection `(SYMBOL)`
- Added macro-event keyword whitelist (regulation/legal events always kept)
- Untracked coins with macro keywords → kept; pure altcoin pumps → filtered

#### 5. Tier-Specific Temperature (article_generator.py)
- L1-L2: 0.3 (factual, concise)
- L3-L4: 0.4 (allows more creative causal reasoning)
- L5: 0.45 (strategic synthesis)

#### 6. Enhanced Inter-Tier Context (article_generator.py)
- L5 receives **richer summaries** from L1-L4 with synthesis instructions
- `_summarize_tier_output()`: Extracts 5 key sentences (up from 3) for L5

#### Tests
- 1 test updated for renamed cross-signal conflict header
- Total: 655 tests pass. Lint clean.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-03-19

### Breaking Pipeline — Deferred Mechanism Fix (8 bugs, 3 clusters)

#### Cluster A — Message Length (Bugs 1, 5, 9)
- `_deliver_breaking()`: Per-event try/except + `split_message()` for TG 4096 char safety.
  One oversized/failed message no longer kills delivery for remaining events.
- `_reprocess_deferred_events()`: Same split_message() treatment for morning alerts.

#### Cluster B — Dedup Persistence (Bugs 2, 8)
- `DedupManager.__init__()`: Dedup entries by hash on load — keeps entry with most-progressed
  status (sent > deferred > pending). Eliminates duplicate rows from BREAKING_LOG.
- `_persist_dedup_to_sheets()`: Append-only fallback now only appends NEW entries (not all rows),
  preventing duplicate row creation when clear_and_rewrite fails.

#### Cluster C — Deferred Mechanism (Bugs 3, 4, 6, 7)
- **C1**: Morning reprocessing rewritten — calls LLM to generate full Breaking News content
  (Approach B), sends each event individually with proper format instead of plain text links.
- **C2**: Removed `deferred_to_daily` (never consumed). Notable events during night → `skipped`.
- **C3**: Content generation failure → `generation_failed` status (not stuck as "pending").
  Morning reprocessing retries failed events once; second failure → `permanently_failed`.
- **C4**: Severity now persisted in dedup entry when classifier runs, enabling proper sort
  and display in morning alerts.

#### Tests
- 7 new tests (dedup on load, severity update, generation_failed retrieval, notable night skipped).
- Total: 655 tests pass. Lint clean.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-03-18

### Data Source Expansion + Summary Generator Rewrite

#### New Collectors
- **Coinalyze** (`collectors/coinalyze_data.py`): Derivatives data via Coinalyze API (OI, Funding
  Rate, Liquidations, Long/Short Ratio) for BTC + ETH. Uses Binance USDT perpetuals (most liquid).
  No geo-blocking from GitHub Actions. 40 req/min. Fallback: OKX → Binance → Bybit.
- **CoinMetrics Community** (`collectors/coinmetrics_data.py`): On-chain fundamentals (NVT, MVRV,
  Active Addresses, Hash Rate) for BTC + ETH. Replaces Glassnode (limited free tier).
  No API key needed. Community tier only (SOPR, Exchange flows are PRO-only). Fallback: Glassnode.
- **Whale Alert** (`collectors/whale_alert.py`): Large transaction tracker (≥$1M) across 20+
  blockchains. New data type — aggregates whale flow direction (exchange in/out), generates
  signal interpretation for LLM context. Paid plans only ($29.95/mo min) — optional,
  pipeline works without key (returns empty summary).

#### Pipeline Integration
- `onchain_data.py`: New fallback chains — Coinalyze → OKX → Binance → Bybit (derivatives),
  CoinMetrics → Glassnode (on-chain).
- `daily_pipeline.py`: Whale Alert added as 8th parallel collector in Stage 1.
  Whale data passed to tier articles (L3+) and summary generator.
- `article_generator.py`: GenerationContext gains `whale_data` field. Tier articles (L3-L5)
  include whale activity in LLM prompt.

#### Summary Generator Rewrite
- **Complete rewrite** of `summary_generator.py` — from 94-line bullet-point generator to
  comprehensive 4-section market overview matching BIC Chat manual format:
  - Section 1: ⭐ Tổng quan (causal analysis paragraphs)
  - Section 2: 📊 Bảng chỉ số (metrics table with emoji markers)
  - Section 3: 👉🏻 Đáng chú ý (VN news + upcoming macro events)
  - Section 4: 📰 Tin tức nổi bật (5-8 articles with analysis)
- Input: Receives full raw data (cleaned_news, market_data, onchain_data, sector_snapshot,
  econ_calendar, metrics_interp, narratives, whale_data) — not just article excerpts.
- Temperature reduced to 0.3 (data-driven), max_tokens increased to 4096.
- Backward-compatible signature (old callers still work).

#### Bug Fixes (post-research API verification)
- **Coinalyze**: Symbol `.6` (non-existent) → `BTCUSDT_PERP.A` (Binance, confirmed).
  Liquidation endpoint response parsing fixed (`history[].l/s` instead of `longLiquidations`).
  Long/Short Ratio endpoint corrected to `/long-short-ratio-history` (no snapshot endpoint).
  Interval `24h` → `daily`.
- **CoinMetrics**: Removed PRO-only metrics (SOPR, Exchange Inflow/Outflow).
  Fixed metric ID `SplyAct1d` → `AdrActCnt`.
- **Whale Alert**: Free plan ~1h lookback (was incorrectly set to 24h).
  Removed `currency` comma-join (API accepts single value only, filter client-side instead).
- **article_generator.py**: `whale_data` was missing from `variables` dict — whale data
  collected but never reached LLM prompts for tier articles. Fixed.
  Also fixed prompt formatting: whale section now uses proper `=== WHALE ALERT ===` header.

#### Tests
- 55 new tests across 6 files (coinalyze, coinmetrics, whale_alert, summary_generator,
  onchain_data, filter_data). Test patterns: graceful degradation, fallback chains,
  data aggregation, prompt structure, whale_data tier filtering, edge cases.
- Total: 648 tests pass. Lint clean.

#### Environment Variables (new)
- `COINALYZE_API_KEY` — free key from coinalyze.net (required for derivatives)
- `WHALE_ALERT_API_KEY` — paid key from whale-alert.io (optional, $29.95/mo min)
- CoinMetrics Community: no key needed

## [0.23.0] - 2026-03-18

### Pipeline Quality Overhaul (25 root causes, 5 phases)

#### Phase 1 — Quick Wins (D1, E1, E2)
- **D1**: Replace hardcoded numbers in L3/L4/L5 tier_context with placeholder templates
  forcing LLM to use real data instead of echoing stale examples.
- **E1**: Filler phrase detection — 7 regex patterns counted (not removed) by NQ05 filter,
  exposed via `filler_count` field for quality gate.
- **E2**: LLM temperature reduced 0.5→0.3 (both daily + breaking) to reduce hallucination.

#### Phase 2 — Breaking News Context Enrichment (A1-A4)
- **A1**: Trafilatura article body extraction (8s timeout, 1500 char cap) for breaking news.
- **A2**: Market snapshot context injected into breaking prompt (BTC price/change, F&G).
- **A3**: Recent events context (last 3 breaking alerts) injected for continuity.
- **A4**: Rewritten breaking prompt template with "Nội dung cốt lõi" + "Bối cảnh & tác động".

#### Phase 3 — Breaking News Classification & Dedup (B1-B4, F4)
- **B1**: Price vs volume percentage distinction in severity classifier — volume % no longer
  inflates severity (e.g., "volume up 50%" stays "normal", not "critical").
- **B2**: Coin whitelist filter — non-CIC coins filtered out of breaking news.
- **B4**: Added "crash" to DEFAULT_IMPORTANT_KEYWORDS.
- **F4**: Similarity-based dedup (SequenceMatcher ≥0.70) catches near-duplicate headlines
  with different wording within cooldown window.

#### Phase 4 — Daily Pipeline Data Quality (F1-F7)
- **F1**: Full article text passed to LLM (800 char cap) instead of 300-char summary.
- **F2**: Top 5 RSS feeds marked `enrich=True` for trafilatura enrichment.
- **F3**: 4 new RSS feeds added (CryptoNews, Bitcoinist, CryptoPotato, BlogTienAo).
- **F5**: Macro article whitelist — Fed/CPI/DXY/interest rate articles bypass crypto filter.
- **F6**: Data quality gate — pipeline aborts if <5 news AND no market data.
- **F7**: Telegram truncation warning logged when message content is split.

#### Phase 5 — Daily Report Anti-Repetition (C1-C3, E5)
- **C1**: Rewritten `_summarize_tier_output()` with structured extraction (coins, numbers,
  key sentences) for inter-tier context passing.
- **C2**: Tier-specific analytical framing in metrics engine — L3 gets "NGUYÊN NHÂN" (causal),
  L4 gets "RỦI RO" (risk/contradictions), L5 gets "KỊCH BẢN" (scenarios).
- **C3**: Cross-tier 4-gram repetition detection — warns when same phrases appear in 3+ tiers.
- **E5**: NQ05 phrase removal — removes only violating phrase (not entire sentence) for prose;
  entire bullet removed for bullet points.

### Test Coverage
- 600 tests (up from 571), all passing
- New test classes: TestFillerDetection, TestPhase5PhraseRemoval, TestPhase2ArticleEnrichment,
  TestPhase2Helpers, TestPhase3CoinFilter, TestSimilarityDedup, TestPhase3Classification,
  TestPhase4FeedEnhancements, TestCrossTierRepetition, plus updated inter-tier and metrics tests

## [0.22.0] - 2026-03-17

### Prompt Architecture Overhaul

- **Fix Gemini API**: Use `system_instruction` parameter instead of concatenating
  system+user prompt. Gemini now processes NQ05 rules with higher priority.
- **Rewrite system prompt**: Role (analyst + investor perspective), 4-step process
  (summarize→find patterns→interpret→present), filler phrase blacklist.
- **Question-driven tier prompts**: Each tier has 3-4 specific questions to answer
  instead of open-ended "write analysis". Includes few-shot example paragraphs.
- **Reduce L5 data**: Cap news at top 20 lines to prevent Groq 413 Payload Too Large.
- **Prompt restructured**: "Context first, questions last" following Gemini best practices.

### Bug Fixes

- **DefiLlama None comparison**: Guard against `tvl=None` from API causing TypeError.
- **Derivatives fallback reorder**: OKX first (only provider working on GitHub Actions),
  removed Binance Spot (also 451 geo-blocked). Binance Futures + Bybit kept as fallbacks.
- **Sector data None guards**: All format_for_llm() comparisons now handle None values.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-03-16

### Phase 1 — Data Architecture Overhaul (Metrics Engine + Inter-Tier Context)

**Root cause (3rd time)**: Previous fixes (v0.13 data enrichment, v0.19 anti-hallucination,
v0.20 tier context redesign) were all prompt engineering — addressing symptoms, not architecture.
All 5 tiers received IDENTICAL data, no inter-tier awareness, and missing pre-computed insights
caused AI to guess/repeat instead of analyze.

**1a. Metrics Engine (NEW: generators/metrics_engine.py):**
- Pre-computed data interpretation replaces LLM guessing
- Funding Rate, OI, Long/Short Ratio → structured conclusions with reasoning
- DXY, Gold, BTC Dominance → macro analysis with cause-effect
- Fear & Greed, Altcoin Season → labeled sentiment with historical context
- Cross-signal analysis: detects agreement vs conflict between indicators
- Volume pattern analysis: top coins + divergence detection
- Tier-specific output: L1-L2 get sentiment only, L3-L5 get derivatives + macro + cross-signals

**1b. Market Regime Classification (in metrics_engine.py):**
- Scoring system classifies: Bull / Bear / Recovery / Distribution / Neutral
- Inputs: BTC price action, F&G, Altcoin Season, DXY, Funding Rate
- Confidence levels: high/medium/low based on signal agreement
- Vietnamese-formatted output included in every tier's prompt

**1c. Inter-Tier Context Passing (article_generator.py):**
- After generating each tier, section headers + first lines are summarized
- Summary passed to next tier as "CÁC TIER TRƯỚC ĐÃ VIẾT" context
- L2 knows what L1 covered, L3 knows L1+L2, etc.
- Eliminates content repetition at the architectural level (not just prompt hints)

**1d. Narrative Detection (in metrics_engine.py):**
- Keyword clustering from RSS news titles (15 narrative categories)
- Categories: ETF, Regulation, DeFi, AI, Exchange, Hack, Stablecoin, L2, etc.
- Top narratives with sample headlines passed to LLM as "CHỦ ĐỀ NÓNG HÔM NAY"
- AI can now write about dominant themes instead of random news

**Pipeline integration (daily_pipeline.py):**
- Removed 80+ lines of scattered interpretation_notes code
- Replaced with 3-line Metrics Engine call: interpret + narratives + format
- GenerationContext extended with metrics_interpretation + narratives_text fields
- Backward compatible: old interpretation_notes field kept as empty fallback

**Phase 2 — Data Source Expansion:**

**2a. Sector Data Collector (NEW: collectors/sector_data.py):**
- CoinGecko `/categories` endpoint — 12 tracked sectors (DeFi, L1, L2, AI, Gaming, Meme, RWA, etc.)
- Market cap + 24h change + volume + top 3 coins per sector
- Formatted as "PHÂN TÍCH THEO SECTOR" context for LLM

**2b. DefiLlama TVL (in sector_data.py):**
- Total DeFi TVL from historical endpoint
- Top 15 protocols by TVL with chain, category, 1d change
- Free API, no key required, no rate limit

**2c. Binance Spot Fallback (onchain_data.py):**
- Added `_derivatives_binance_spot()` using `api.binance.com` (not geo-blocked)
- Provides BTC spot volume, price change as derivatives proxy
- Attempts Binance Coin-M funding rate (alternative endpoint)
- Fallback chain now: Binance Futures → Binance Spot → Bybit → OKX

**Pipeline integration:**
- `collect_sector_data()` added to parallel Stage 1 collection
- `SectorSnapshot.format_for_llm()` passed to each tier via `sector_data` field
- GenerationContext extended with `sector_data: str` field
- L2-L5 now have real sector data for analysis (previously empty)

**Phase 3 — Prompt Optimization (leveraging new data architecture):**

**3a. Tier-Specific Data Filtering (article_generator.py):**
- `_filter_data_for_tier()` reduces noise for lower tiers
- L1: BTC/ETH prices + F&G + top 5 news only (no on-chain, sector, macro events)
- L2: Full market + sector + news (no on-chain details)
- L3: Full analytical data, reduced news (already in L1/L2)
- L4: On-chain + sector + macro focus, minimal news
- L5: Everything (scenario analysis needs full context)

**3b. Data Quality Monitor (NEW: generators/data_quality.py):**
- `assess_data_quality()` scores data completeness 0-100 (A/B/C/D/F)
- Scoring: News 25pts, Market 25pts, On-chain 20pts, Sector 15pts, Econ 15pts
- Vietnamese warnings passed to LLM when data is degraded
- `is_degraded` flag (score < 40) for pipeline-level decisions
- Integrated into daily_pipeline.py with logging

**3c. Tier Prompt Refinement (daily_pipeline.py):**
- L1: Uses Market Regime from Metrics Engine (no more LLM guessing bullish/bearish)
- L2: References CoinGecko/DefiLlama sector data for grouping coins
- L3: Delegates derivatives interpretation to Metrics Engine (removed inline guide)
- L4: Uses cross-signal analysis for risk detection, sector risk from DefiLlama
- L5: Uses sector rotation data + regime confidence for scenario analysis
- Trimmed redundant "KIẾN THỨC NỀN" block in prompt (Metrics Engine handles this)

**Tests: 80 new tests total (562 total, 100% pass)**
- TestMarketRegime: 9 tests (bull, bear, neutral, recovery, distribution, edge cases)
- TestInterpretMetrics: 11 tests (tier formatting, derivatives, cross-signals)
- TestNarrativeDetection: 9 tests (detection, filtering, formatting)
- TestSummarizeTierOutput: 5 tests (header extraction, fallback, truncation)
- TestSectorSnapshot: 3 tests (formatting with/without data)
- TestCoinGeckoCategories: 4 tests (parsing, HTTP error, network error, sorting)
- TestDefiLlama: 2 tests (TVL + protocols, failure handling)
- TestCollectSectorData: 2 tests (integration, partial failure)
- TestDataQualityReport: 5 tests (grades, formatting, threshold boundaries)
- TestAssessDataQuality: 10 tests (perfect score, no data, partial, boundaries)
- TestFilterDataL1-L5: 20 tests (per-tier data filtering)
- TestFilterDataEdgeCases: 2 tests (empty context, metrics table preservation)

## [0.20.0] - 2026-03-15

### Phase 1 — Prompt Redesign & Output Quality (ICS Anti-Repetition)

**Root cause**: All 5 tiers received same data with nearly identical prompts, causing massive
content repetition visible to higher-tier members who see all lower-tier content via ICS structure.

**1A. Tier Context Redesign (daily_pipeline.py):**
- Each tier now answers a DIFFERENT question:
  L1="Hôm nay thế nào?", L2="Coins nào?", L3="Tại sao?", L4="Rủi ro?", L5="Nếu X thì sao?"
- Each tier explicitly states "MEMBER ĐÃ ĐỌC tier thấp hơn — KHÔNG lặp lại"
- Different tone per tier: L1=casual, L2=professional, L3=analytical, L4=risk-focused, L5=formal
- L2 must mention ≥10/19 coins with sector grouping
- L3-L5 have explicit "KHÔNG LÀM" lists to prevent content overlap
- Each tier has specific "NỘI DUNG BẮT BUỘC" checklist

**1B. Prompt Engineering (article_generator.py):**
- Removed bad example "vùng tích lũy trước đợt tăng mới" (NQ05 borderline prediction)
- Added domain knowledge block: Funding Rate, OI, F&G, BTC Dominance, DXY interpretation
- Added negative examples with ⚠️ SAI markers (wrong FR/OI interpretation, NQ05 violations)
- Added anti-fabrication examples (MVRV, correlation coefficient, smart money)
- URLs now passed in news_text for LLM to reference actual source links

**1C. NQ05 Filter Overhaul (nq05_filter.py):**
- Banned keywords now remove ENTIRE SENTENCE (was: replace with "[đã biên tập]" leaving broken text)
- New `_remove_sentences_with_pattern()` handles both prose and bullet points
- Added 5 semantic NQ05 patterns: "vùng tích lũy trước đợt tăng", "cơ hội tốt để tích lũy",
  "smart money đang mua", "thời điểm tốt để mua", "nên cân nhắc mua"
- Removed auto-append disclaimer (was causing double disclaimer with article_generator)

**1D. Summary Generator Fix (summary_generator.py):**
- Added `check_and_fix()` NQ05 filter call before appending disclaimer (was skipped entirely)

**1E. Breaking News Improvements (content_generator.py):**
- Prompt now receives event URL + summary from raw_data (was: title only → filler content)
- Clarified NQ05 allows naming specific assets (BTC, ETH, SOL...)
- Structured output now includes 🔗 source link

**1F. Post-Generation Validation (article_generator.py):**
- New `_validate_output()` scans LLM output for fabricated metrics
  (MVRV, SOPR, Exchange Reserves, whale data, liquidation data, correlation coefficients)
- L2 coin count check: warns if <5 coins mentioned (target: ≥10)
- Banned source citation check (Bloomberg, CryptoQuant, TradingView, etc.)
- All warnings logged for pipeline monitoring

**1G. Pipeline Stability Fixes (post-deploy):**
- `_TIER_COOLDOWN` 45→60s, `_TIER_RETRY_WAIT` 60→120s — Groq free tier TPM limit
  caused L3-L5 rate limit failures with insufficient cooldown
- Fixed NQ05 violation in interpretation note: "giai đoạn tích lũy trước breakout"
  → "volume thấp thường đi kèm biến động mạnh sau đó (hướng chưa rõ)"
- On-chain prompt header: removed "Glassnode, Binance Futures, Bybit" (geo-blocked/unavailable),
  now shows only "OKX, FRED" to prevent LLM citing unavailable sources
- Disabled 7 dead RSS feeds (BeInCrypto_VN 403, CCN 403, DLNews 404, Reuters DNS fail,
  Bankless 403, CoinMetrics 403, Galaxy_Digital 404) — `enabled=False` for easy re-enable
- `sheets_client.read_all()`: filters out empty-key dict entries from corrupt sheet headers
- `sheets_client.clear_and_rewrite()`: auto-repairs header row against schema definition
  (fixes BREAKING_LOG duplicate empty columns causing context load failure)

## [0.19.0] - 2026-03-15

### Anti-Hallucination & Output Quality

**Fix 1 — Anti-Hallucination (article_generator.py):**
- Removed "Theo CoinLore/Glassnode" example from NQ05_SYSTEM_PROMPT that was INSTRUCTING LLM to cite fabricated sources
- Added "CHỐNG BỊA DỮ LIỆU" rule: LLM can only cite sources from provided data
- Added "QUY TẮC DỮ LIỆU TUYỆT ĐỐI" block in article prompt with source whitelist/blocklist
- Added "KIỂM TRA CUỐI CÙNG" guardrail: whitelist of allowed sources at end of prompt
- Glassnode + Messari moved to ALLOWED list (they ARE real data sources in onchain_data.py + rss_collector.py)
- On-chain source label updated: "Glassnode, Binance Futures, Bybit, OKX, FRED"
- L2 tier_context: removed "support/resistance" instruction that invited LLM to fabricate price levels

**Fix 2 — Data Cleaning Before LLM (daily_pipeline.py, economic_calendar.py):**
- New `_format_onchain_value()`: Funding Rate → percentage format (e.g. -0.0056% instead of -5.55e-05), large numbers → B/M suffixes, ratios → 4 decimal places
- Key metrics Funding Rate now shows percentage format
- Economic events `recent_events`: label changed to "ĐÃ DIỄN RA" with "ĐÃ QUA" tag — prevents LLM from writing past events as "sắp tới"
- Added Funding Rate + OI correlation hints in interpretation notes (OI uses `_format_onchain_value()` instead of hardcoded "B USD")
- Economic events prompt instruction: explicit "KHÔNG viết sự kiện đã qua như 'sắp tới'"

**Fix 3 — Severity Classifier (severity_classifier.py):**
- Added 16 new important keywords: drops, falls, plunges, surges, soars, selloff, rally, war, attack, missile, sanctions, Iran, escalation, invasion, liquidated, sell-off
- Added price-movement percentage detection: X% in title where X≥3 → important, X≥10 → critical
- Word-boundary matching (`\b`) for ALL keywords — fixes "ban" matching inside "Binance" (false CRITICAL)

**Fix 4 — Breaking News Format (breaking_pipeline.py, content_generator.py, dedup_manager.py):**
- Breaking prompt rewritten: 300-400 → 100-150 words (critical: 200-250), no hedge language, structured as "Chuyện gì xảy ra" + "Tại sao quan trọng"
- AI-generated breaking content now includes NQ05 DISCLAIMER (was only on raw fallback)
- DedupEntry: added `url` field (8-column schema) — deferred events now retain URL
- BREAKING_LOG schema in sheets_client.py: 7 → 8 columns (added URL header)
- `_load_dedup_from_sheets()`: now reads URL column from sheet
- Fixed double dedup load: single `dedup_mgr` shared across pipeline stages (was loading twice, second overwriting first)
- Removed dead `url=` kwarg from content_generator `.format()` call
- Deferred morning alert: sorted by severity, includes severity emoji + URL link

**Fix 5 — Crypto Relevance Filter (data_cleaner.py):**
- New `_filter_non_crypto()` step in cleaning pipeline
- 70+ keywords: 50 crypto + 18 macro/finance (SEC, ETF, Fed, FOMC, CPI, inflation, tariff, DXY, etc.)
- Word-boundary matching for short keywords (≤3 chars) — prevents "sol" matching "solution", "eth" matching "method"
- Crypto-only sources (Coin68, TapChiBitcoin, BeInCrypto) bypass keyword check

**Fix 6 — Breaking → Daily Context Sharing (daily_pipeline.py, article_generator.py):**
- New `_load_recent_breaking_context()`: reads BREAKING_LOG for events within 24h
- New `recent_breaking` field in GenerationContext
- Injected into article prompt: "SỰ KIỆN BREAKING GẦN ĐÂY (24h qua — PHẢI nhắc đến trong bài)"
- Daily report now references breaking news from previous night

**Tests:** 471 passed (+21 new), 0 regressions
- Severity classifier: keyword tests, percentage detection, word-boundary tests (ban vs Binance)
- Data cleaner: non-crypto filter, crypto bypass, macro terms, substring false positive tests
- Article generator: anti-hallucination guardrails, Glassnode in allowed list
- Content generator: AI path DISCLAIMER, word targets
- Daily pipeline: `_format_onchain_value()` for funding rate, ratio, large/small numbers
- Dedup manager: URL field, 8-column row

## [0.18.0] - 2026-03-14

### FR60 — Economic Calendar Integration + Template Upgrade

**Economic Calendar Collector (NEW):**
- New `collectors/economic_calendar.py`: fetches macro-economic events from FairEconomy feed
- Filters High-impact USD events relevant to crypto (Fed, FOMC, CPI, PPI, NFP, GDP, etc.)
- 30+ event titles in `CRYPTO_RELEVANT_EVENTS` set (exact + prefix matching)
- Auto-splits events into today vs upcoming, formats as Vietnamese text for LLM prompt
- Graceful fallback: returns empty CalendarResult on any error (HTTP, JSON, timeout)
- Integrated as 6th parallel collector in `daily_pipeline.py` via `asyncio.gather()`
- New `economic_events` field in `GenerationContext` dataclass

**Template Upgrade (AutoSetup.gs):**
- L1: 2→3 sections (added "Kết luận & Sự kiện sắp tới")
- L2: 2→3 sections (added "Xu hướng & Sự kiện vĩ mô")
- L3: 2→4 sections (On-chain + Vĩ mô & Lịch sự kiện + Derivatives + Tổng hợp)
- L4: 2→4 sections (Sector + Sentiment & Derivatives + Sự kiện vĩ mô + Cảnh báo)
- L5: 2→6 sections (Executive Summary + Macro + On-chain + Sector + Liên thị trường + Risk)
- Each section prompt includes specific economic event analysis instructions
- L4 TIER_MAX_TOKENS: 3072→4096 (supports 4 sections)

**Article Generator:**
- `economic_events` variable injected into LLM prompt with "LỊCH SỰ KIỆN KINH TẾ VĨ MÔ" header
- Economic context only added when events are available (no empty sections)

**Tests:** 440 passed (+14 new), 0 regressions
- 14 new tests: `_is_crypto_relevant()`, `EconomicEvent`, `CalendarResult.format_for_llm()`, `collect_economic_calendar()` (5 scenarios)
- Test fixture: `economic_calendar_sample.json` (10 events)

**Version sync:** config.py, pyproject.toml, Menu.gs, test_config.py → 0.18.0

---

## [0.17.0] - 2026-03-14

### PRD Remediation — 24 findings across 5 clusters (R1→R3→R2→R4→R5)

**R1 — Config & Templates:**

- Version sync: config.py, pyproject.toml, GAS Menu.gs all at 0.17.0

**Tests:** 426 passed, 0 regressions

---

## [0.16.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added — CryptoPanic Fallback: RSS + LLM Scoring + Market Triggers

**LLM Scorer (`breaking/llm_scorer.py`) — NEW:**
- RSS-based breaking event scoring when CryptoPanic unavailable
- Batch LLM prompt: scores up to 20 articles in 1 call (efficiency)
- Keyword pre-filter: matching articles bypass LLM (faster, no quota)
- Time filter: only scores articles published within last 6 hours
- Graceful degradation: LLM failure returns keyword-only matches

**Market Trigger (`breaking/market_trigger.py`) — NEW:**
- Always-on price crash detection (not a fallback, runs every time)
- BTC drop > 7% in 24h → automatic breaking event
- ETH drop > 10% in 24h → automatic breaking event
- Fear & Greed Index < 10 → Extreme Fear breaking event
- Uses existing market data collector (no new API calls)

**Breaking Pipeline Fallback Chain:**
- 3-layer detection: CryptoPanic (primary) → RSS+LLM (fallback) → Market triggers (always-on)
- CryptoPanic failure (quota/error/timeout) triggers automatic RSS fallback
- Market triggers run alongside primary detection (additive, not exclusive)
- All sources merge before dedup — no duplicate alerts
- 50 new tests, 426 total, 0 regression

---

## [0.15.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added — Research Integration + Telegram Formatting + CryptoPanic Quota Fix

**Research Feed Integration (Cụm 1):**
- 4 research feeds: Messari, Glassnode Insights, CoinMetrics, Galaxy Digital
- `source_type` field ("news" vs "research") on FeedConfig + NewsArticle
- `og_image` extraction via trafilatura for research articles
- `full_text` enrichment for research articles (up to 2000 chars)
- `asyncio.Semaphore(25)` limits concurrent HTTP requests
- Data cleaner preserves `og_image` and `source_type` through dedup

**CryptoPanic API Quota Fix (GP1-4):**
- Breaking pipeline: hourly → every 3h, skip UTC 0-5 (750→180 calls/month)
- QuotaManager integrated into both CryptoPanic collectors
- File-based cache (2h TTL) prevents redundant API calls
- New `core/cache.py` module for simple file-based caching

- First occurrence of each source name wrapped in clickable `<a href>` tag
- `source_urls` and `image_urls` passed through article dict to delivery

---

## [0.14.3] - 2026-03-12

### Changed — F2: CAU_HINH Self-Documenting Email Config

**Operator (no-code user) chỉ cần mở Google Sheet để quản lý email:**
- Tab CAU_HINH được seed sẵn row `email_recipients` khi setup lần đầu
- Cột "Mô tả" hướng dẫn đầy đủ tiếng Việt: THÊM / XÓA / Ví dụ format
- Không cần terminal, không cần tool — edit trực tiếp cell trong Sheet
- `seed_setting()`: append row nếu key chưa có, skip nếu đã có (không overwrite)
- `seed_default_config()`: seed tất cả default rows, idempotent
- `create_schema()` tự gọi `seed_default_config()` khi setup

**Xóa `scripts/manage_email_recipients.py`** — CLI tool không phù hợp no-code user.

**Thêm `scripts/setup_schema.py`** — one-time dev script khi tạo spreadsheet mới.

---

## [0.14.2] - 2026-03-12

### Added — F2 (Tiếp): Email Recipients Management via CAU_HINH

**SheetsClient.upsert_setting():**
- Tìm key trong CAU_HINH → update nếu có, append nếu chưa có
- Cột: `Khóa | Giá trị | Mô tả`

**ConfigLoader.set_email_recipients():**
- Ghi danh sách email vào CAU_HINH (upsert), tự động xóa cache sau khi lưu

**scripts/manage_email_recipients.py:**
- CLI tool để quản lý email backup từ terminal (không cần vào GitHub)
- Commands: `list`, `add <email>`, `remove <email>`, `set <email1,email2,...>`

---

## [0.14.1] - 2026-03-12

### Added — F2: Email Backup với Lý Do Telegram Thất Bại

**Email body giờ bao gồm lý do Telegram fail:**
- `send_daily_report()` nhận param mới `telegram_error: str | None`
- Khi Telegram fail hoàn toàn hoặc partial → lý do + timestamp UTC append vào body
- `delivery_manager.py` tự động capture error và truyền qua

**Email recipients cấu hình được từ Google Sheets (CAU_HINH):**
- `ConfigLoader.get_email_recipients()` đọc key `email_recipients` từ CAU_HINH
- Format: `a@gmail.com, b@gmail.com` (comma-separated, có thể thêm nhiều người)
- Fallback: `SMTP_RECIPIENTS` env var nếu chưa có trong sheet
- `_deliver()` đọc từ sheet mỗi lần chạy — không cần redeploy khi đổi email

---

## [0.14.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added — F1: Derivatives Data Migration (Binance Futures)

**Thay thế Coinglass v2 (deprecated) bằng Binance Futures public API:**
- Binance Futures làm primary source (GitHub Actions servers ở US/EU, không bị chặn)
- Bybit v5 làm first fallback, OKX v5 làm second fallback
- 4 metrics mới: `BTC_Funding_Rate`, `BTC_Open_Interest`, `BTC_Long_Short_Ratio`, `BTC_Taker_Buy_Sell_Ratio`
- Không cần API key — tất cả public endpoints
- Provider-level fallback: nếu Binance fail thì thử Bybit, rồi OKX

### Added — F3: RSS Feed Expansion (+5 sources)

**Thêm 5 nguồn tin mới (từ 12 lên 17 feeds):**
- `BeInCrypto_VN` — vn.beincrypto.com (Vietnamese)
- `CCN` — ccn.com (English crypto news)
- `Blockworks` — blockworks.co (institutional crypto)
- `DLNews` — dlnews.com (DL News)
- `Reuters` — feeds.reuters.com/reuters/businessNews (financial news)
- `Bankless` — banklesshq.substack.com (DeFi/Web3)

---

## [0.13.1] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed — Hotfix Wave E (Cleanup)

**E1: Xóa 3 RSS feed chết**
- `TNCK` (404), `BitcoinMag` (403), `BeInCrypto` (403) bị gọi mỗi ngày nhưng không bao giờ thành công
- DEFAULT_FEEDS: 15 → 12 feeds

**E2: Refactor breaking_pipeline dùng private `sheets._connect()`**
- Thêm public method `SheetsClient.clear_and_rewrite()` thay thế truy cập private
- Fix luôn bug cũ: `batch_append` luôn chạy kể cả khi delete thành công (double-write)
- Thêm 4 test cases cho `clear_and_rewrite()`

### Fixed — Hotfix Wave B (Pipeline Reliability)

**D1: Fix test version mismatch**
- Test assert `VERSION == "0.13.0"` → `"0.13.1"` (CI sẽ fail nếu không sửa)

**D2: ValueError → LLMError trong article_generator**
- `raise ValueError(...)` → `raise LLMError(...)` — đúng chuẩn QĐ3 (CICError hierarchy)

**D3: Xóa dead code escape_markdown_v2()**
- Hàm `escape_markdown_v2()` trong telegram_bot.py không được gọi ở đâu → xóa cùng tests

**D5: Bật SSL verification cho Altcoin Season Index**
- `verify=False` → `verify=True` — sửa lỗ hổng bảo mật HTTPS

**D6: Fix ErrorEntry mutation side effect**
- `_trim_error_history()` sửa trực tiếp input object → dùng `dataclasses.replace()` tạo copy

**D7+D8: Xóa dead code to_row() trong GeneratedArticle + GeneratedSummary**
- Hai hàm `to_row()` không được gọi trong pipeline (pipeline dùng dict trực tiếp) → xóa cùng tests + unused imports

**C1: Tách Concurrency Group + Offset Cron**
- Daily pipeline và Breaking News dùng chung concurrency group → block nhau khi trigger cùng lúc
- Tách thành `daily-pipeline` / `breaking-news` groups, daily cron offset 5 phút (01:05 UTC)

**C3: Pipeline Fail Khi Delivery Gửi 0 Tin**
- `_deliver()` catch exception nhưng không propagate → pipeline báo "success" dù delivery fail
- `_deliver()` giờ return `DeliveryResult`, `_run_pipeline()` check 0-sent → set status "error" + `sys.exit(1)`
- Partial delivery (ví dụ 3/6 sent) vẫn là "partial", không fail pipeline

**C5: Fix pyproject.toml Version**
- Version `0.12.0` không khớp `core/config.py` `0.13.0` → sửa đồng bộ

**H6: Validate Groq Empty Response**
- Groq thiếu validation empty text (Gemini đã có 2 lớp)
- Thêm validation trong `_call_groq()` + safety net trong `generate()` cho TẤT CẢ providers

**M1: HTML Escape cho Telegram Messages**
- `parse_mode="HTML"` nhưng không escape `<`, `>`, `&` → TG parsing error
- Thêm `html.escape()` trong `_send_raw()` — tầng thấp nhất, cover mọi message

### Fixed — Data Context Starvation (Root Cause of Generic Output)

**Root cause**: Pipeline collected rich data but compressed it to titles+prices before passing to LLM, causing generic output lacking insight.

**Wave A — Quick Wins (LLM Context Enrichment):**
- Spam articles (`filtered=True`) now excluded from LLM context (was polluting prompt)
- News text enriched with article summaries (300 chars each) instead of titles only
- Market text enriched with volume + market cap alongside price/change
- CryptoPanic `summary` field populated from full_text when API returns empty
- LLM temperature 0.3 → 0.5 for more natural, varied analysis
- BIC Chat summary excerpt 300 → 800 chars for richer source context

**Wave B — Data Enrichment (New Metrics FR10/FR20):**
- Added **ETH Dominance** collection from CoinLore API
- Added **TOTAL3** (altcoin market cap) calculated from dominance percentages
- Added **Altcoin Season Index** from BlockchainCenter API (graceful degradation)
- KEY_METRICS_LABELS expanded 7 → 11 items (ETH Dominance, TOTAL3, Altcoin Season, USDT/VND)
- Key metrics mapping in pipeline: ETH_Dominance, TOTAL3, Altcoin_Season → dashboard
- Anomaly detection flags: Extreme Fear/Greed (≤20/≥80), significant BTC moves (≥5%)
- Gemini `_call_gemini()` now raises `LLMError` on empty candidates/text (was silently returning "")
- Improved on-chain collector logging (Glassnode warnings, Coinglass zero-value alerts)

**Wave C — Tier Differentiation:**
- Per-tier Vietnamese analysis instructions (L1=beginner, L2=technical, L3=on-chain+macro, L4=risk, L5=comprehensive)
- `TIER_MAX_TOKENS` dict: L1=2048, L2=3072, L3=4096, L4=3072, L5=6144 (was fixed 4096)
- `GenerationContext.tier_context` field added to pass tier-specific instructions to LLM
- L4 tier explicitly warns: "TUYỆT ĐỐI KHÔNG đưa ra tỷ lệ phân bổ cụ thể (%) — vi phạm NQ05"

**Wave D — NQ05 Hardening:**
- Added `ALLOCATION_PATTERNS` (3 regex patterns) detecting portfolio allocation percentages
- `check_and_fix()` Step 1b: scans and removes allocation patterns (e.g., "30% cho BTC")
- Per-violation audit trail logging with `logger.warning()`

**Wave E — Infrastructure & Breaking News:**
- gh-pages deploy: replaced git-stash-based approach with proper fetch/checkout (race condition fix)
- Dashboard `_trim_error_history()`: assigns default timestamp for errors without one
- Breaking `_calculate_panic_score()`: clarified docstring (panic score ≠ sentiment score)

### Tests
- Fixed 4 tests broken by Wave A-E changes (Gemini empty candidates, coinlore 4 points, 11 metrics)
- All tests passing: 357+ passed, 0 failed

### Stats
- Version: 0.12.0 → 0.13.0
- Metrics tracked: 7 → 11 (KEY_METRICS_LABELS)
- LLM context: ~5% of collected data → ~60% (summaries, volume, mcap, anomalies)
- NQ05 patterns: keyword-only → keywords + allocation regex + per-tier warnings
